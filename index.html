                <h3>Cooking is lethal</h3>
                <img class="col-3 img right" src="http://culinarylore.wdfiles.com/local--files/food-science:how-hot-before-cooking-oil-ignites/lid-on-grease-fire.jpg" />
                <p>According to a study published in Nature Magazine September 2015 air particles smaller than 2.5mc are responsible for an average of 3.3 million premature deaths in 2010. The interesting fact is that particles of organic provenience bring a lot more casualties than crust material, nitrates or sulphates. But the reason I ended up writing this article is the following phrase: “3.54 million deaths per year caused by indoor air pollution”. Did I read right? Yes it is INDOOR air pollution, and further on I discover that the outmost evil is cooking. Of course it is about India and China, but it is still difficult to overlook the fact that in China casualties caused by cooking are “approximately an order of magnitude higher than that attributable to Chinese road transport injuries and HIV/AIDS”. I think I made my point ;) be safe, go out!</p>
